### Fuel fumes in Bramley High Street - update on FaceBook from Jane Austin (in the Bramley Update Group)
<br>
*Once again last night following heavy rain Bramley is experiencing the smell of fuel and evidence of fuel in the stream (see video). I have reported this to the Environment Agency and continue to encourage everyone to report any evidence. I am told investigations are ongoing and I have received the following update from EPS who are the petrol stationâ€™s remediation consultants. Hopefully this will go some way to help explain what work is being undertaken right now.*
