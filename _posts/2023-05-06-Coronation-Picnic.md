### Sunday 7th May - 12:00 onwards ###
<br>

No street party?  No problem.  Do join us in the Walled Garden at Gosden House School for an afternoon hopefully in the sunshine!  To keep things simple, this is a 'bring your own' food, drink, and something to sit on event.  Please note:  Dogs welcome, but must be kept on a lead.  

#### Directions ####

The Walled garden is at the rear of Gosden House School.  Please note that the Main Gates to the school will be closed - we will be using the side entrance which is close to the Cricket Pavillion. The route to the Walled Garden will be sign-posted from the A281 turning onto Tannery Lane  - just follow the â™› signs.   You can drive into the school and park next to the Walled Garden. <br>
