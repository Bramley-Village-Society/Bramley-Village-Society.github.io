### Diesel/Heating fuel fumes in Bramley High Street - update  

The issue continues.  Latest update from the Linersh Wood Association (Jane Austin)

The petrol/ fume smell continues to be very strong in the Jolly Farmer and is affecting trade. It seems to be worse after the water table rises following rain and an oil / fuel type substance is often present in the river. We have had the Environment Agency and Waverley investigating this issue for months, so far to no avail. However, I learned that last Sunday the Co-op petrol station had fuel tanks re-lined as they were apparently faulty. We are now working on the hypothesis that fuel may have escaped over a period of time. This is just a theory for now - a testing device has been placed in the Jolly Farmer which should answer this question definitively and we are urgently following this up with the EA, Trading Standards and Co-op. I hope this finally gets to the bottom of it and I will be working hard to push for answers on this.
