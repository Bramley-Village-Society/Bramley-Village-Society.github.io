### Diesel/Heating fuel fumes in Bramley High Street - update  

The issue continues.  Latest update from Jermey Hunt

*BRAMLEY SAGA CONTINUES Last Friday, local volunteers noticed the awful smell had returned, and led them to the river. Very worryingly, some sort of chemical film was seen on the surface of the water - so a huge well done to local campaigner Jane Austin, along with local residents Charlotte and Claire, for obtaining a sample and reporting the incident to the Environment Agency (EA). I have raised this directly with Alan Lovell, Chair at the EA, and asked him to facilitate the collection and testing of the sample. Alan has since informed me that his staff attended the site on Saturday to assess the stream. They confirmed that very small amounts of oil were visible, but that there was no evidence of significant, ongoing contamination. Given the heavy rainfall on Friday (the smell is always worse after a downpour), Alan thinks the oil resulted from urban surface water drainage, but the EA did collect more samples yesterday morning. I will of course keep you posted, but in the meantime, if there are any further incidents, please report them directly to the EA hotline on 0800 807060.*
