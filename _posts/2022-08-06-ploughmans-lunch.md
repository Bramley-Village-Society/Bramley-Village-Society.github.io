 Come and meet your fellow Bramley residents whilst enjoying a simple lunch of bread, cheese, pork pie and salad with a glass of Bramley cider, wine or soft drink.<br>
The Bramley Village Society holds the lunch annually as a social event for all residents of the parish. This year the lunch is being held in the garden of Mill Cottage, Mill Lane, Bramley, by kind permission of Stuart and Camilla White.
This is a family event and caters for all generations. There will be competitions for the children.<br>
Please note:
 - Mill Cottage has a number of open streams and ponds, as you can see from the views above, so children will need to be supervised at all times. 
 - Parking is very limited, so if driving please park in the villge and enjoy the walk up Mill Lane.
