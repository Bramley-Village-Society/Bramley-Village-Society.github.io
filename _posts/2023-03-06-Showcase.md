### 8.00pm Tuesday 28th March in Bramley Village Hall

Bramley Village Showcase is an annual event run by the Bramley Village Society to publicise the varied selection of local clubs and societies to both recent arrivals in the village and more established residents.
As many local clubs and societies as possible are encouraged come and set out their wares in the Village Hall, so that you can see what is available.

All organisations need to recruit new members if they are to continue to thrive, and you can expect to be made very welcome, whether simply as an interested participant in their activities or by eventually getting more involved in helping to run things.

To help the evening along, we provide a free glass of wine, Bramley cider, or a soft drink on your arrival.
Everyone is welcome to drop in, so why not come and socialise with other residents.

The Village Society is particularly keen that new residents find out what is available in Bramley, so if you have new neighbours who may not have signed up to the Bramley Update, please encourage them to attend the Bramley Showcase - it's a fun evening, and an easy way to get integrated into village life.

If your local club, society, or voluntary organisation hasn’t attended the Showcase evening before and would like to this year, please contact the Village Society by [email](mailto:bramleyvillagesociety@gmail.com), phone Joe O’Connell on 01483 894250, or use our [contact form](/contact)
