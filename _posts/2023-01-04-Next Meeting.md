### Our next meeting is on Thursday 2nd February, 20:00 in the Village Hall Meeting Room <br><br>

All residents are welcome.  Please check this website before attending the meeting in case the meeting is cancelled at short notice.

On the agenda - do join us if you are interested:<br>
- The **Bramley Showcase** will be in the Village Hall on the evening of Tuesday 28 March.  Please let us know if you wish to be represented.  More details [here](/event/showcase)
- Our **St George’s Dinner**: As St George's Day(23 April) falls on a Sunday next year, we need to check availability of our usual venue (the Jolly Farmer), and possibly arrange an alternative. More details [here](/event/st-georges-day-dinner)
- The **King's Coronation** is on Saturday the 6th May next year, with the following Monday being a bank holiday.  We are considering organising a village wide event – please let us know if you have any ideas.
