### Diesel/Heating fuel fumes in Bramley High Street - update  

Bramley smell update from Jeremy Hunt: _After last week’s smell came back, the petrol station has been closed periodically this week and a number of boreholes have been drilled and sampled for evidence of fuel on and off site. This investigation is ongoing so I will keep you updated with more information as I get it but Bramley’s own Cllr Sherlock Holmes (Jane Austin) is all over the issue._
