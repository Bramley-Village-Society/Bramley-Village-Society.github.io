### Diesel/Heating fuel fumes in Bramley High Street - update  

Bramley smell update from Jeremy Hunt: _After last week’s smell came back, the petrol station has been closed periodically this week and a number of boreholes have been drilled and sampled for evidence of fuel on and off site. This investigation is ongoing so I will keep you updated with more information as I get it but Bramley’s own Cllr Sherlock Holmes (Jane Austin) is all over the issue._

Update from Jeremy Hunt: _Over the last week or so I have been liaising with Bramley petrol station’s senior management team, and they believe the odour to be related to two incidents where a customer’s vehicle tank failed on the forecourt (November 2022 and March 2023). It seems possible that it is also linked to issues with the gauge risers in both tanks 2 and 4. Environmental consultants have visited the site and have confirmed that a small amount of fresh fuel was found in two boreholes near the store and exit crossover which could have come from customer fuel tanks. The fuel has since been removed, and the boreholes will be re-checked this week to see if there is any recurrence of the presence of fuel. In the meantime, samples of the fuel have been obtained and sent for analysis to confirm the fuel type, and to estimate how long it's been there. The management have reassured me that the site is currently safe and compliant, and that they are acutely aware of the concerns of the local community, not least the poor Jolly Farmer that is the business most affected. I will keep you updated_
