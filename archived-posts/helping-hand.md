Bramley Helping Hand is a community initiative to fundraise and offer practical help and financial support to all members of our local community.
If you, or someone you know, may benefit from a helping hand in these challenging times, please:

- email us on [bramleyhelpinghand@gmail.com](mailto:bramleyhelpinghand@gmail.com)
- speak to Rev Andy or Father Alastair 
- get in touch with Bramley Parish Council

All requests are managed confidentially and promptly. 

If you would like to donate to Bramley Helping Hand, they have a [Just Giving page](https://www.justgiving.com/crowdfunding/bramleyhelpinghand%3Futm_term=4kE7aDYbq).  All donations are greatly appreciated. 


Bramley Helping Hand will soon be setting up a 'community trolley' for donations of essential food and toiletries - more information to follow.
