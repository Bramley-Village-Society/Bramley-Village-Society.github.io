The BVS has a remit to maintain and improve the material fabric of the parish.   In the past, Bramley has been cared for by the residents, the Parish Council and the BVS working together; sometimes resulting in recognition, e.g. Best Kept Surrey Village in 1986.

More recently there are signs of a lack of attention to our environment, sometimes due to a lack of money but also maybe due to a lack of visibility of the issue itself, who is responsible for its rectifaction, and the current state of any actions taken.   The BVS would like to see more effort applied to keeping Bramley a great place to live and work, and to that end agreed at the 2022 AGM that we would keep a list of items that need attention and monitor progress on their resolution.
