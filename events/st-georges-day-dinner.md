**St. George's Day Dinner - 23rd April - Price to be finalised**

Every year the Bramley Village Society holds an annual dinner to celebrate our patron saint; normally in the evening of St. George's Day itself (23rd April).  All are very welcome to come and enjoy an evening meal, which this year will not be in the Jolly Farmer as their kitchen is not open on Tuesday evenings.  However, we are hoping to arrange the event in the Village Hall with the meal being prepared by volunteers so that we can raise funds for [Bramley Helping Hand](/helping-hand). 

If you would like to be part of an 'English' tradition, please [contact us](/contact).  Tickets will also be available at the  [Bramley Showcase](/event/showcase).

Please note that tickets must be bought in advance and places are limited.
